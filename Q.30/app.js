// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
let users = [`sana`, `sehrish`, `honey`, `muzzmil`, `admin`];
for (let user of users) {
    if (user === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Hello ${user}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
}
