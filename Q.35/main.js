// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. •
//  Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • 
//  Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
// You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var petAnimal = [
    "cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"
];
// using a for loop
for (var _i = 0, petAnimal_1 = petAnimal; _i < petAnimal_1.length; _i++) {
    var onePet = petAnimal_1[_i];
    console.log("A ".concat(onePet, " would make a great pet."));
}
//  print a message outside of for loop
console.log("Any of these animal would make a great pet!");
