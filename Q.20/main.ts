// Q.no 20 Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let languages : string[]=[
    "English", "Urdu", "Franch", "Arabic","Korean"
]
console.log ("list of languages:")
for (let top of languages){
    console.log (top)
}
